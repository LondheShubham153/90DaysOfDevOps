# Multi-Stage Builds in Docker

## Benefits of Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds in Docker offer several advantages, including:

1. **Smaller Image Size**:
   - By using multiple stages, you can copy only the necessary artifacts to the final image. This means that all the dependencies and build tools used in the intermediate stages do not end up in the final image, resulting in a significantly smaller image size.

2. **Improved Security**:
   - A smaller image surface area reduces the potential attack vectors. Only the essential files and dependencies are included in the final image, which minimizes the chances of vulnerabilities.

3. **Enhanced Build Efficiency**:
   - Multi-stage builds allow for better layer caching. Changes in the final stages do not invalidate the earlier stages' cache, leading to faster build times when making incremental changes.

4. **Simplified Dockerfile Management**:
   - Using multiple stages within a single Dockerfile can make it easier to manage complex build processes. Each stage can focus on a specific task, such as compiling code, running tests, and creating the final image.

## Impact on Image Size

The primary impact of multi-stage builds is the reduction in image size. Here's how it works:

- **Intermediate Stages**: These stages contain all the necessary tools and dependencies to build and test the application. However, they are not included in the final image.
- **Final Stage**: This stage contains only the minimal runtime environment and the application's artifacts (e.g., binaries, configuration files). As a result, the final image is much smaller compared to a single-stage build.
