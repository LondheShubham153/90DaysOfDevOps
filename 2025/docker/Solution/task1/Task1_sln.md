What is Docker?
Docker is a popular platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers.

What are containers?
A container is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable software package that contains everything needed (code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings) to run a piece of software.
Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, ensuring consistent operation across various computing environments.
