### Task 8: Orchestrate with Docker Compose
1. **Create a docker-compose.yml File:**  
   - Write a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines at least two services (e.g., your sample app and a database).
   - Include definitions for services, networks, and volumes.
2. **Deploy Your Application:**  
   - Bring up your application using:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   - Test the setup, then shut it down using:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```
3. **Document the Process:**  
   - Explain each service and configuration in your `solution.md`.
