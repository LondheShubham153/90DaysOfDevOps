### Task 9: Analyze Your Image with Docker Scout
1. **Run Docker Scout Analysis:**  
   - Execute Docker Scout on your image to generate a detailed report of vulnerabilities and insights:
     ```bash
     docker scout cves <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0
     ```
   - Alternatively, if available, run:
     ```bash
     docker scout quickview <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0
     ```
     to get a summarized view of the imageâ€™s security posture.
   - **Optional:** Save the output to a file for further analysis:
     ```bash
     docker scout cves <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0 > scout_report.txt
     ```
