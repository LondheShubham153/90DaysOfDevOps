# Networking
Networking in DevOps is about managing how different systems and applications communicate with each other. The key aspects are:

**Infrastructure Management**: Setting up and maintaining networks, subnets, and routing between systems.

**Automation**: Using tools like Ansible and Terraform to automate network configurations and reduce manual work.

**Container Networking**: Managing communication between containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cloud Integration**: Setting up virtual private clouds (VPCs), security groups, and connecting cloud services with on-premises systems.

**Security**: Implementing firewalls, access controls, and monitoring network traffic to ensure secure communication.

The main goal is to create reliable, secure, and automated network infrastructure that supports continuous development and deployment of applications. This helps teams deploy faster while maintaining stability and security.

# OSI and TCP/IP Network Models Explained

## Overview
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model consists of 7 layers, while TCP/IP has 4 layers that map to OSI's layers. Below is a detailed breakdown with real-world examples for each layer.

## OSI Model Layers (Top to Bottom)

### 1. Application Layer (OSI & TCP/IP)
**Purpose**: Handles direct user interaction and application-specific protocols.

**Real-world examples with Chrome and "www.google.com"**:
- Chrome uses HTTP/HTTPS to request the webpage
- SMTP when sending emails
- FTP when downloading files

### 2. Presentation Layer (OSI)
**Purpose**: Handles data translation, encryption, and compression.

**Real-world examples**:
- Opening JPEG images (format conversion)
- Using HTTPS (SSL/TLS encryption)
- Watching compressed video streams

### 3. Session Layer (OSI)
**Purpose**: Manages sessions between applications.

**Real-world examples**:
- Online banking login (maintaining authenticated sessions)
- Zoom calls (managing video call sessions)
- Online gaming (tracking game sessions)

### 4. Transport Layer (OSI & TCP/IP)
**Purpose**: Ensures reliable data delivery.

**Real-world examples**:
- TCP: File downloads (ensuring complete delivery)
- UDP: Live video streaming (prioritizing speed)

### 5. Network Layer (OSI) / Internet Layer (TCP/IP)
**Purpose**: Handles logical addressing and routing.

**Real-world examples**:
- Home router IP address routing
- GPS navigation routing (similar concept)

### 6. Data Link Layer (OSI) / Network Access Layer (TCP/IP)
**Purpose**: Manages physical addressing and local network access.

**Real-world examples**:
- WiFi MAC address device identification
- Ethernet switch traffic direction

### 7. Physical Layer (OSI) / Network Access Layer (TCP/IP)
**Purpose**: Transmits raw bits over physical medium.

**Real-world examples**:
- Ethernet cable electrical signals
- Fiber optic light pulses
- WiFi radio waves

## Practical Email Sending Scenario

### Layer-by-Layer Process
1. **Application Layer**: 
   - Email composition in Gmail
   - "Send" button click

2. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Message encoding
   - Encryption process

3. **Session Layer**:
   - Email server connection maintenance

4. **Transport Layer**:
   - TCP reliable delivery protocol

5. **Network Layer**:
   - IP routing across internet

6. **Data Link Layer**:
   - Frame movement between devices

7. **Physical Layer**:
   - Electrical signal transmission through cables
