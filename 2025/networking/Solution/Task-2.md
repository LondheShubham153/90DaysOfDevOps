Task 2: Protocols and Ports for DevOps

What Are Protocols and Ports?

Protocols are a set of rules that define how data is transmitted over a network. Each protocol is associated with a specific port number, which helps in directing network traffic efficiently. In DevOps, understanding these protocols is essential for managing infrastructure, securing connections, and ensuring smooth application communication.

1. HTTP (Port 80): HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is used for web communication. DevOps teams use it for web servers, APIs, and microservices. For example, when a CI/CD pipeline deploys a web application, it often interacts with an HTTP-based API.

2. HTTPS (Port 443): HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, using encryption to protect data. It is critical in DevOps for securing web applications, API communications, and preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. Websites and cloud services require HTTPS to protect user data.

3. FTP (Port 21): FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring files between a client and a server. DevOps engineers may use it to move logs, configuration files, or backups between systems. However, it is considered insecure and is often replaced by SFTP.

4. SFTP (Port 22): SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) operates over SSH, providing a secure way to transfer files. It is used in DevOps to automate file transfers between servers in cloud environments.

5. SSH (Port 22): SSH (Secure Shell) allows secure remote access to servers. DevOps professionals use it to manage infrastructure, deploy applications, and automate tasks using tools like Ansible and Terraform. SSH keys enhance security by replacing password authentication.

6. DNS (Port 53): DNS (Domain Name System) resolves domain names to IP addresses. It plays a crucial role in cloud-based deployments and container orchestration, ensuring that applications can communicate with services using human-readable domain names instead of IP addresses.
