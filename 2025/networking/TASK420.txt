1st Day: We learned about Networking Topologies.

Networking topologies refer to the arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a computer network. Common types include:

- Bus Topology
- Star Topology
- Ring Topology
- Mesh Topology
- Tree Topology
- Hybrid Topology

Each topology has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.
