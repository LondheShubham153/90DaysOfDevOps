# Week 1: Networking Challenge

Welcome to Week 1 of the **90 Days of DevOps - 2025 Edition**! This week's focus is on **Networking**, a foundational skill for every DevOps professional. Let's dive into understanding key networking concepts, tools, and tasks essential for building a strong DevOps career.

## Tasks

### 1. **Understand OSI & TCP/IP Models**
- Learn about the OSI and TCP/IP models, including their layers and purposes.
- **Task:** Write examples of how each layer applies to real-world scenarios (e.g., HTTP at the Application Layer, TCP at the Transport Layer).

### 2. **Protocols and Ports for DevOps**
- Study the most commonly used protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, DNS) and their port numbers.
- **Task:** Create a blog, article, GitHub page, or README listing these protocols and explaining their relevance to DevOps workflows.

### 3. **AWS EC2 and Security Groups**
- Launch an AWS EC2 instance (free tier is fine).
- Learn about Security Groups, their rules, and their significance in securing cloud instances.
- **Task:** Write a step-by-step guide or blog on how to create and configure Security Groups.

### 4. **Hands-On with Networking Commands**
- Practice essential networking commands like:
  - `ping` (check connectivity)
  - `traceroute` / `tracert` (trace packet routes)
  - `netstat` (network statistics)
  - `curl` (make HTTP requests)
  - `dig` / `nslookup` (DNS lookup)
- **Task:** Create a cheat sheet or short guide explaining the purpose and usage of each command.
