# 🌐 Hands-On with Networking Commands

## 📌 Overview
Networking commands are essential tools for diagnosing, monitoring, and configuring network settings. DevOps engineers rely on these commands to troubleshoot connectivity issues, optimize performance, and ensure seamless communication between distributed systems.

## 🚀 **Essential Networking Commands**

### ✅ **1. `ping` (Check Connectivity)**
- `ping` sends ICMP echo requests to a target and measures the response time.
- Used to verify whether a remote server or device is reachable.
- Helps detect **packet loss** and **network latency**.
- **Usage Example:**
```sh
ping google.com
```
- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - Imagine you're **calling a friend** to see if they answer; if they reply, they are online (reachable). If they don’t, they might be offline or unreachable.

---

### ✅ **2. `traceroute` / `tracert` (Trace Packet Routes)**
- `traceroute` (Linux/macOS) or `tracert` (Windows) maps the path packets take to reach their destination.
- Useful for detecting network bottlenecks and slow hops.
- **Usage Example:**
```sh
traceroute google.com  # Linux/macOS
tracert google.com      # Windows
```
- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - If you're **traveling to a destination**, `traceroute` shows every checkpoint (router) along the way, identifying potential delays or detours.

---

### ✅ **3. `netstat` (Network Statistics)**
- Displays **active connections, listening ports, routing tables, and protocol statistics**.
- Helps monitor open ports and detect unauthorized network activity.
- **Usage Example:**
```sh
netstat -tulnp   # Show listening ports on Linux
netstat -an      # Show all active network connections
```
- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - Like **checking a restaurant’s reservation list**, `netstat` helps track which guests (connections) are currently present and which tables (ports) are occupied.

---

### ✅ **4. `curl` (Make HTTP Requests)**
- Fetches data from or sends data to a URL using HTTP/HTTPS.
- Supports REST APIs, file transfers, and authentication.
- **Usage Example:**
```sh
curl -I https://example.com  # Fetch HTTP headers
curl -o file.html https://example.com  # Download a webpage
```
- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - If you’re **ordering food online**, `curl` acts like your order request, while the website responds with your order confirmation.

---

### ✅ **5. `dig` / `nslookup` (DNS Lookup)**
- Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- `dig` provides detailed DNS query information (Linux/macOS), `nslookup` is common on Windows.
- **Usage Example:**
```sh
dig google.com
nslookup google.com
```
- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - Imagine **looking up a friend’s contact number** in a phonebook (DNS), translating their name into an IP address.

---

### ✅ **6. `ifconfig` / `ip addr` (Check Network Interfaces)**
- Displays or configures a system’s network interfaces.
- **Usage Example:**
```sh
ifconfig  # Linux/macOS (deprecated in some versions)
ip addr show  # Modern alternative in Linux
```
- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - Checking your **Wi-Fi settings** to see which network you’re connected to and what your local IP address is.

---

### ✅ **7. `tcpdump` (Packet Analysis)**
- Captures and inspects network packets for debugging.
- **Usage Example:**
```sh
tcpdump -i eth0  # Capture traffic on eth0 interface
```
- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - Like **checking CCTV footage**, `tcpdump` lets you analyze network activity in real-time to detect potential security issues.

---

### ✅ **8. `iptables` (Firewall Management - Linux)**
- Manages packet filtering and network security.
- **Usage Example:**
```sh
iptables -L  # List firewall rules
```
- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - If your house has a **security guard**, `iptables` defines who is allowed to enter (accepted packets) and who is denied entry (blocked packets).

---

### ✅ **9. `whois` (Domain Information Lookup)**
- Retrieves ownership and registration details of a domain.
- **Usage Example:**
```sh
whois google.com
```
- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - Like **checking a company registry**, `whois` lets you see who owns a domain and their contact details.

---

## 🔍 **Real-World Scenario: Diagnosing a Website Issue**
**Problem:** Your website is slow or unreachable.
1. Use `ping example.com` to check if the server is online.
2. Use `traceroute example.com` to check where the delay happens.
3. Use `dig example.com` to verify the domain resolves to the correct IP.
4. Use `netstat -tulnp` to ensure the web server is listening on the correct port.
5. Use `curl -I example.com` to check if the web server responds with the right HTTP headers.
