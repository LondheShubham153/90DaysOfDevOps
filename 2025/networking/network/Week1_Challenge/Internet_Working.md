# How Does the Internet Work?

The internet connects billions worldwide through a fascinating system of cables and servers. Here’s a simple breakdown:

---

## 🌍 1. Global Network of Cables  
The internet relies on **optical fiber cables**, which carry data as light pulses:
1. **On Land**: Cables connect cities and countries.  
2. **Underwater**: Submarine cables link continents, forming the backbone of international internet traffic.

💡 **Did You Know?** Submarine cables carry **99% of global internet traffic**.

## ⚡ 2. The Data Packet Journey  
When you send a request (e.g., opening a website):  
1. **Your device sends a data request**, broken into packets.  
2. These packets pass through:  
   - **Local Servers**: Closest to your location.  
   - **Regional Servers**: Handle traffic for larger regions.  
   - **Global Servers**: Route requests across continents.

3. The response data is processed, reassembled, and returned to your device.

## 🌊 3. Submarine Cables: The Backbone of the Internet  
- Submarine cables span **thousands of kilometers**, transmitting terabytes of data every second.  
- They’re shielded to protect against threats like earthquakes and anchors.

💡 **Fun Fact**: Damaged cables are repaired by ships, which retrieve them from the ocean floor using grappling hooks.

## 🌐 4. Networking Hierarchy  
The system operates through a tiered structure:  
- **Tier 1 Companies**: Own global infrastructure (e.g., **AT&T, Tata Communications**).  
- **Tier 2 Companies**: Lease bandwidth to serve regional areas (e.g., **Jio, Airtel**).  
- **Tier 3 Companies**: Serve end-users (e.g., **JioFiber, FatplayFiber**).

## 🚀 5. The Future of Connectivity  
While optical fiber and submarine cables dominate, **satellite internet** (e.g., Starlink) is emerging as a solution for remote areas.
