Using git stash
git stash is used to save your local modifications temporarily and clean your working directory. Itâ€™s particularly useful in the following scenarios:

. Switching Branches: When you need to switch branches but don't want to commit incomplete work.

. Pulling Changes: When you want to pull changes from a remote repository, but you have uncommitted changes that might cause conflicts.

. Temporary Hold: When you want to save your work temporarily to focus on another task and come back to it later.


Difference Between git stash pop and git stash apply
git stash pop:
Applies the most recent stash and then removes that stash entry from the stack.
Command: git stash pop

git stash apply:
Applies the most recent stash (or a specific stash) but keeps the stash entry in the stack.
