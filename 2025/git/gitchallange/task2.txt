**Task 2: Initialize a Local Repository and Create a File**:

---

### ✅ **1. Set Up Your Challenge Directory**

From inside your cloned `90DaysOfDevOps` repo:

```bash
mkdir week-4-challenge
cd week-4-challenge
```

---

### ✅ **2. Initialize a Git Repository**

Run:

```bash
git init
```

This creates a new `.git` directory, allowing Git to start tracking changes within this folder.

---

### ✅ **3. Create a File**

Use your preferred editor or command-line tool to create the file. For example:

```bash
echo "Your Name - A brief intro about yourself" > info.txt
```

You can also use:

```bash
nano info.txt
```

…and manually type your content, then save and exit.

---

### ✅ **4. Stage and Commit Your File**

1. **Stage the file:**

   ```bash
   git add info.txt
   ```

2. **Commit the file:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add info.txt with introductory content"
   ```
