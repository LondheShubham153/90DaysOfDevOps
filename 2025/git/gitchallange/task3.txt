**Task 3: Configure Remote URL with PAT and Push/Pull** step-by-step:

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Configure Remote URL with Your PAT**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Embedding your **Personal Access Token (PAT)** in a URL is not safe for production use. For better security, use Git credential managers or SSH in real projects.

If `origin` doesn't exist yet:

```bash
git remote add origin https://<your-username>:<your-PAT>@github.com/<your-username>/90DaysOfDevOps.git
```

If `origin` already exists:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-PAT>@github.com/<your-username>/90DaysOfDevOps.git
```

üìå **Example** (Don‚Äôt use this literally‚Äîreplace placeholders):

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://johndoe:ghp_abcd1234xyz@github.com/johndoe/90DaysOfDevOps.git
```

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Push Your Commit to Remote**

Assuming you're still on `main`:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

The `-u` flag sets the upstream, so future pushes can simply use `git push`.

---

### ‚úÖ **3. (Optional) Pull Remote Changes**

To verify that your remote is properly set and active:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

‚úÖ **Done!** Now your local changes are pushed to your GitHub fork. Let me know if you'd like help setting up a `.gitignore`, branching strategy, or working with pull requests.
