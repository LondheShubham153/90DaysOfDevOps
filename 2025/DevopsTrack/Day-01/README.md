# 🚀 90 Days of DevOps Challenge

Welcome to my personal journey through the **#90DaysOfDevOps** challenge inspired by the **#TrainWithShubham** community. This repository documents daily learnings, tasks, resources, problems and their solutions as well as mini-projects from **Day 1 to Day 90**.

## 📅 Day 01: Introduction of DevOps

## 🧠 What is DevOps?

DevOps is all about bringing together the development and operations teams to close the gap between building software and running it. It helps deliver software faster and more smoothly by focusing on:

- Automation  
- Collaboration  
- Continuous Integration (CI)  
- Continuous Deployment (CD)  

The main goal is to make software delivery more efficient and reliable while creating a culture where everyone shares responsibility and keeps improving.

## 🕰️ History and Evolution of DevOps

As software development sped up with Agile and cloud technology, the old way of working—where developers and operations worked separately—couldn’t keep up. Things were slow, and teams often struggled to communicate.

In 2009, Patrick Debois, a Belgian engineer, introduced the term **“DevOps”** at the first DevOpsDays conference. The idea was simple: bring development and operations together, break down barriers, automate as much as possible, and speed up software delivery.

## 🧩 Why DevOps is Needed in the Software Industry

The software world is always changing, and companies need to release products faster and more reliably. Before DevOps, developers often had to wait weeks or months to get their code live because teams worked in silos and relied on manual testing and deployment. This caused delays and errors.

With DevOps, things changed. Automation took over many manual tasks, continuous integration and deployment made releasing code quicker, and better monitoring helped catch problems early. It transformed how software is built and delivered.
