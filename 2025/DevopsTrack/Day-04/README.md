# 📅 Day 04: Resume Building Workshop + Linux Practice

---

## 🗃️ Resume Building Workshop

In today’s competitive job market, companies often receive between **20,000–25,000 applications per day**. To manage this scale, they use **ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)** — software that scans, filters, and shortlists resumes **before** a human recruiter sees them.

### 🔑 Key Learnings from Shubham Londhe’s Workshop:

**1. How ATS Works in Modern Hiring**  
ATS tools look for correct formatting, structure, and relevant keywords. Only the top-matching resumes are passed on to recruiters.

**2. Avoid Keyword Stuffing & AI-Generated Summaries**  
Overusing keywords unnaturally or pasting AI-generated summaries can cause your resume to be **flagged or skipped** by ATS filters.

**3. Resume Myths Busted (Online Builders)**  
Many online resume builders charge for "ATS-friendly" resumes but often generate colorful, image-heavy formats that are **not compliant** with ATS systems.

**4. Best Format for Freshers**  
Stick to a **1-page resume**. Don’t fake experience or overload it with unrelated certifications. Focus on honest, relevant information.

**5. Use Harvard-Style Templates with Google Docs**  
Prefer simple, proven layouts like **Harvard-style templates**. Use **Google Docs** to edit and maintain clean formatting.

**6. Understand Recruiter Psychology**  
A recruiter typically spends **6–8 seconds** scanning a resume. Make it easy to read with a logical flow and focused bullet points.

**7. Use the STAR Format**  
Describe your work using the **STAR method**:  
**Situation → Task → Action → Result**  
This helps recruiters quickly understand your impact.

## 🖥️ Linux Practice – Advanced File Management

Continued hands-on practice with more powerful Linux commands and utilities. Focus areas:

- `rm *.txt`, `rm -r folder/`, `rm -i`, `rm folder/*` – delete files/folders safely and forcefully
- `rmdir folder/` – delete only empty folders
- `vim`, `less`, `head`, `tail` – view and edit files
- `>`, `sort`, `find`, `wc`, `touch`, `tree` – various file handling, searching, and viewing tools


Also explored:
- Difference between `bin/` (general user commands) and `sbin/` (system-level admin tools)
### Difference Between `bin/` and `sbin/`

| Feature                | `/bin`                             | `/sbin`                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Purpose                |  **user commands** used by all users. |  **system administration commands** used by the root or superuser. |
| User Access            | Accessible and used by **all users**. | Typically used by **system administrators** (root). |
| Examples               | `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `bash` | `ifconfig`, `reboot`, `iptables`, `fdisk` |
| Typical Commands       | Basic file and system management utilities. | Commands for system maintenance and network configuration. |
| Location               | `/bin` is for general binary executables. | `/sbin` is for system binary executables. |
