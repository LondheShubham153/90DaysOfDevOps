# Day 50: Your CI/CD pipeline on AWS - Part-1 üöÄ ‚òÅ

What if I tell you, in next 4 days, you'll be making a CI/CD pipeline on AWS with these tools.

- CodeCommit
- CodeBuild
- CodeDeploy
- CodePipeline
- S3

## What is CodeCommit ?

- CodeCommit is a managed source control service by AWS that allows users to store, manage, and version their source code and artifacts securely and at scale. It supports Git, integrates with other AWS services, enables collaboration through branch and merge workflows, and provides audit logs and compliance reports to meet regulatory requirements and track changes. Overall, CodeCommit provides developers with a reliable and efficient way to manage their codebase and set up a CI/CD pipeline for their software development projects.

# Task-01 :

- Set up a code repository on CodeCommit and clone it on your local.
- You need to setup GitCredentials in your AWS IAM.
- Use those credentials in your local and then clone the repository from CodeCommit

# Task-02 :

- Add a new file from local and commit to your local branch
- Push the local changes to CodeCommit repository.
