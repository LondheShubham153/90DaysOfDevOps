This is my day10 submission file :

## Task 1:
 Add a text file called version01.txt inside the Devops/Git/ with “This is first feature of our application” written inside. 
 This should be in a branch coming from `master`, 
 [hint try `git checkout -b dev`], 
 swithch to `dev` branch ( Make sure your commit message will reflect as "Added new feature").

 - version01.txt should reflect at local repo first followed by Remote repo for review.

 Add new commit in `dev` branch after adding below mentioned content in Devops/Git/version01.txt:
 While writing the file make sure you write these lines
 
 - 1st line>>  This is the bug fix in development branch
 - Commit this with message “ Added feature2 in development branch”
 
 - 2nd line>> This is gadbad code
 - Commit this with message “ Added feature3 in development branch
 
 - 3rd line>> This feature will gadbad everything from now.
 - Commit with message “ Added feature4 in development branch

 Restore the file to a previous version where the content should be “This is the bug fix in development branch”
