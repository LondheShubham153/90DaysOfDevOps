# Day 15 Task: Python Data Types and Data Structures for DevOps


Basic structure of a Python program:
A Python program is made up of one or more statements. Each statement is executed one after the other in the order they are written. A Python program can contain multiple statements, which are often organized into functions, classes and modules.

Role of indentation:
Indentation is used in Python to indicate a block of code. When a block of code is indented, it means that it is part of the statement or function above it. In Python, the indentation level is used to indicate a block of code, rather than curly braces {} or keywords like 'begin' and 'end'.

The input() function:
The input() function is used to accept input from the user. When the input() function is called, the program will pause and wait for the user to enter some text, which is then returned as a string. The text entered by the user is known as the input. For example, 

name = input("What is your name? ")

print("Hello", name)

## Task-2:
Use the knowledge gained from the video to complete the following tasks:
   - Use the create an input() function to get the user's name and age as input.
   - Use the print() function to print out the message "Hello [name], you are [age] years old."
   - Submit your code on github repo

## Task-3
Learn about the basics of functions in Python and why they are useful for organizing and reusing code.
