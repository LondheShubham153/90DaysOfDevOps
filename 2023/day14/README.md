## Day 14 Task: Python Data Types and Data Structures for DevOps

### New day, New Topic.... Let's learn along üòâ

### Data Types

- Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
- Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
- Python has the following data types built-in by default: Numeric(Integer, complex, float), Sequential(string,lists, tuples), Boolean, Set, Dictionaries, etc

To check what is the data type of the variable used, we can simply write:
`your_variable=100`
`type(your_variable)`

### Data Structures

Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.

- Lists
  Python Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type

- Tuple
  Python Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list but Tuples are immutable in nature i.e. the elements in the tuple cannot be added or removed once created. Just like a List, a Tuple can also contain elements of various types.

- Dictionary
  Python dictionary is like hash tables in any other language with the time complexity of O(1). It is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds the key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized

## Tasks

1. Give the Difference between List, Tuple and set. Do Handson and put screenshots as per your understanding.
2. Create below Dictionary and use Dictionary methods to print your favourite tool just by using the keys of the Dictionary.

```
fav_tools =
{
  1:"Linux",
  2:"Git",
  3:"Docker",
  4:"Kubernetes",
  5:"Terraform",
  6:"Ansible",
  7:"Chef"
}
```

3. Create a List of cloud service providers
   eg.

```
cloud_providers = ["AWS","GCP","Azure"]
```

Write a program to add `Digital Ocean` to the list of cloud_providers and sort the list in alphabetical order.

[Hint: Use keys to built in functions for Lists]
