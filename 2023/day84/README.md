# Project-5

=========

# Project Description

The project involves deploying a Netflix clone web application on a Kubernetes cluster, a popular container orchestration platform that simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications. The project will require creating Docker images of the web application and its dependencies and deploying them onto the Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes manifests. The Kubernetes cluster will provide benefits such as high availability, scalability, and automatic failover of the application. Additionally, the project will utilize Kubernetes tools such as Kubernetes Dashboard and kubectl to monitor and manage the deployed application. Overall, the project aims to demonstrate the power and benefits of Kubernetes for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale.
