#how to give file creation dir creation permission to new user so he can create file with out sudo
#To allow a new user to create files and directories without using sudo, you need to grant them the necessary permissions
#on the desired directory. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:
#Add User to a Group: First, ensure the user is part of a group that has write permissions on the directory.
#You can create a new group and add the user to it, or use an existing group.

sudo groupadd mygroup       # Create a new group (if needed)
sudo usermod -aG mygroup newuser  # Add user to the group

#Change Group Ownership of the Directory: Change the group ownership of the directory where you want the user to have write permissions.

sudo chown -R :mygroup /path/to/directory

#Set Directory Permissions: Grant write permissions to the group on the directory and ensure new files/directories created within inherit these permissions.

sudo chmod -R 775 /path/to/directory        # Grant read/write/execute permissions
sudo chmod g+s /path/to/directory           # Set the 'setgid' bit for inheritance
su - newuser                                # Switch to the new user
touch /path/to/directory/newfile.txt        # Create a file
mkdir /path/to/directory/newdirectory       # Create a directory

#By following these steps, the new user should be able to create files and directories without needing sudo. Let me know if you have any questions or run into issues!

#Here are the Linux commands to accomplish each task:

## View the content of a file and display line numbers
echo "Viewing file with line numbers:"
nl filename
cat -n filename
