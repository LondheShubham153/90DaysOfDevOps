#!/bin/bash

for (( i=1;i<=$2;i++))

ls
2:  Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.
 #!/bin/bash

Backup_directory="/Users/wd-21121/Desktop/DevOps/*"
Backups="/Users/wd-21121/Desktop/backup"
date=$(date +"%d-%b-%Y")

mkdir $Backups/$date
cp -r $Backup_directory $Backups/$date

echo "Backup created in $Backups/$date"

3: Read About Cron and Crontab, to automate the backup Script:

 edit or delete entries to cron. A crontab file is a user file that holds the scheduling information.
