Day 4 Task: Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers.

 What is Kernel

 The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer’s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.
 
 What is Shell

 A shell is special user program which provide an interface to user to use operating system services. Shell accept human readable commands from user and convert them into something which kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that execute commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.
 
 What is Linux Shell Scripting?

 A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a linux shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

 **Tasks**

 - Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.
   Shell scripting - Shellscript is a file in which we write bunch of shell commands/instructions that we wanted to execute repeatedly over the period of time in sequence order and pass it as an input to the shell interpreter. The shell interpreter reads the shell commands from the file and executes them from top to bottom in linear/sequential order one after of the another one is called "shellscripting"

 - What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?
   #!/bin/bash -
   shebang is instruction we are writing to the shellinterpreter asking to use which shell to execute the instructions in the file
    in the above statement we are telling the interpreter program to use bash interpreter to execute the instructions/commands in the file.
  

 - Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge`
  echo "I will compleate the #90daysof DevOps challenge".

 - Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.


 - Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers


 Was it difficult?
 
 - Post about it on LinkedIn and Let me know :)
