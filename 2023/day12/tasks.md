Now why not make an interesting 😉 assignment, which  not only will help you for the future but also for the DevOps Community!

Let’s make a well articulated and documented **"cheat-sheet"** with all the commands you learned so far in Linux, Git-GitHub and brief info about its usage.

Let’s  show us your knowledge mixed with your creativity😎
