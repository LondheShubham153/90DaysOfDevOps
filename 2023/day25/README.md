# Day 25 Task: Complete Jenkins CI/CD Project - Continued with Documentation

I can imagine catching up will be tough so take a small breather today and complete the Jenkins CI/CD project from Day 24 and add a documentation.

## Did you finish Day 24?

- Day 24 will give you an End to End project and adding it to your resume will be a cherry on the top.

- take more time, finish the project, add a Documentation, add it to your Resume and post about it today.

# Task-01

- Document the process from cloning the repository to adding webhooks, and Deployment, etc. as a README , go through [this example](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/fynd-my-movie/blob/master/README.md)

- A well written readme file will help others to understand your project and you will understand how to use the project again without any problems.

# Task-02

- Also it's important to keep smaller goals, as its a small task, think of a small Goal you can accomplish.

- Write about it using [this template](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shubhamlondhe1996_taking-resolutions-and-having-goals-for-an-activity-7023858409762373632-s2J8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

- Have small goals and strategies to achieve them, also have a small reward for yourself.
