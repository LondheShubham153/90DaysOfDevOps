# Day 52: Your CI/CD pipeline on AWS - Part 3 üöÄ ‚òÅ

On your journey of making a CI/CD pipeline on AWS with these tools, you completed AWS CodeCommit & CodeBuild.

Next few days you'll learn these tools/services:

- CodeDeploy
- CodePipeline
- S3

## What is CodeDeploy ?

- AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services.

CodeDeploy can deploy application content that runs on a server and is stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. CodeDeploy can also deploy a serverless Lambda function. You do not need to make changes to your existing code before you can use CodeDeploy.

# Task-01 :

- Read about Appspec.yaml file for CodeDeploy.
- Deploy index.html file on EC2 machine using nginx
- you have to setup a CodeDeploy agent in order to deploy code on EC2

# Task-02 :

- Add appspec.yaml file to CodeCommit Repository and complete the deployment process.
