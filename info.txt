Week 4 - Git and GitHub Challenge

Name: Shaival Mehta

We are in Week 4 of Zero to Hero Junoon Batch 9. This has been a great month of starting with basics of linux, networking, shell scripting, Git and GitHub, and now moving towards Docker, Jenkins, and further advanced topics. 

I recently participated in Hackathon and it was great learning and impleneting experience. 

Would like to give a big thank you to Shubham bhai. He is an amazing teacher, who understands how to get attention of the students and make sure that 3-4-5 hour long lectures are not boring and everyone are engaged enough to learn and understand the concepts thoroughly. 

Thank you!
