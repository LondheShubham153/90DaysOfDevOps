# Day 8: Shell Scripting Challenge - All Tasks in One Script

# Task 1: Comments
# This script covers multiple tasks: using echo, defining and using variables,
# using built-in variables, and working with wildcards in Bash.

# Task 2: Echo
# Display a greeting message to the user
echo "Welcome to Day 8 of the #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge!"

# Task 3: Variables
# Declare variables to store data. Here, we use variables for a name and numbers.
name="DevOps Learner"
num1=20
num2=30

# Display the value of the "name" variable
echo "Hello, $name! Let's learn some shell scripting."

# Task 4: Using Variables
# Calculate the sum of two numbers stored in variables
sum=$((num1 + num2))
# Display the result
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $sum"

# Task 5: Using Built-in Variables
# Bash provides several built-in variables to use.
# Displaying three commonly used built-in variables
echo "Current script name: $0"      # The name of the script
echo "Number of arguments passed: $#"  # Number of arguments passed to the script
echo "PID of the current shell: $$"  # PID of the current shell

# Task 6: Wildcards
