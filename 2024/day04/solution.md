# Day 4 Answers: Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers

Task 1: Explain in your own words and with examples what Shell Scripting means for DevOps.
- 'Shell Scripting is writing a series of commands in a script file to automate tasks in the Unix/Linux shell. For DevOps, shell scripting is crucial for automating repetitive tasks, managing system configurations, deploying applications, and integrating various tools and processes in a CI/CD pipeline. It enhances efficiency, reduces errors, and saves time.'

Task 2: What is `#!/bin/bash`? Can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?
- `#!/bin/bash` is called a "shebang" line. It indicates that the script should be run using the Bash shell.
  - `#!/bin/bash`: Uses Bash as the interpreter. It supports advanced features like arrays, associative arrays, and functions.
  - `#!/bin/sh`: Uses the Bourne shell. Itâ€™s more POSIX-compliant and is generally compatible with different Unix shells.
