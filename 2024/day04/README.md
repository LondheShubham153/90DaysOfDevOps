# Day 4 Task: Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers

## What is Kernel?

The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer’s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.

## What is Shell?

A shell is a special user program that provides an interface for users to interact with operating system services. It accepts human-readable commands from users and converts them into instructions that the kernel can understand. The shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. It starts when the user logs in or opens a terminal.

## What is Linux Shell Scripting?

Linux shell scripting involves writing programs (scripts) that can be run by a Linux shell, such as bash (Bourne Again Shell). These scripts automate tasks, perform system administration tasks, and facilitate the interaction between users and the operating system.

**Tasks:**

- Explain in your own words and with examples what Shell Scripting means for DevOps.
- What is `#!/bin/bash`? Can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?
- Write a Shell Script that prints `I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps challenge`.
- Write a Shell Script that takes user input, input from arguments, and prints the variables.
- Provide an example of an If-Else statement in Shell Scripting by comparing two numbers.

**Were the tasks challenging?**

These tasks are designed to introduce you to basic concepts of Linux shell scripting for DevOps. Share your experience and solutions on LinkedIn and let me know how it went! :)
