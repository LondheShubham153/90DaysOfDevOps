# Day 44: Relational Database Service in AWS

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud

## Task-01

- Create a Free tier RDS instance of MySQL
- Create an EC2 instance
- Create an IAM role with RDS access
- Assign the role to EC2 so that your EC2 Instance can connect with RDS
- Once the RDS instance is up and running, get the credentials and connect your EC2 instance using a MySQL client.

Hint:

You should install mysql client on EC2, and connect the Host and Port of RDS with this client.

Post the screenshots once your EC2 instance can connect a MySQL server, that will be a small win for you.
