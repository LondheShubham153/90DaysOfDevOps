# Day 20 Task: Docker for DevOps Engineers

## Finally!! 🎉

You have completed ✅ the Docker hands-on sessions, and I hope you have learned something valuable from it. 🙌

Now it's time to take your Docker skills to the next level by creating a comprehensive cheat-sheet of all the commands you've learned so far. This cheat-sheet should include commands for both Docker and Docker Compose, along with brief explanations of their usage. Not only will this cheat-sheet help you in the future, but it will also serve as a valuable resource for the DevOps community. 😊🙌

So, put your knowledge and creativity to the test and create a cheat-sheet that truly stands out! 🚀

For reference, I have added a [cheatsheet](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670863735841/r6xdXpsap.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp). Make sure your cheat-sheet is UNIQUE.

Post it on LinkedIn and share your knowledge with the community. 😃

**Happy Learning :)**
