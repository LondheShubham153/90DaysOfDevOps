# Day 18 Answers:  Docker for DevOps Engineers

Till now you have created a Dockerfile and pushed it to the repository. Let's move forward and dig deeper into other Docker concepts. Today, let's study Docker Compose! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Docker Compose

- Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications.
- With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and, with a single command, spin everything up or tear it all down.
- Learn more about Docker Compose [here](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/docker/docker-compose/).

## What is YAML?

- YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. Depending on whom you ask, YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language" or "YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language" (a recursive acronym), which emphasizes that YAML is for data, not documents.
- YAML is a popular programming language because it is human-readable and easy to understand.
- YAML files use a .yml or .yaml extension.

## Task 2
   
   - **1. Pull a pre-existing Docker image from a public repository (e.g. Docker Hub) and run it on your local machine. Run the container as a non-root user (Hint: Use the `usermod` command to give the user permission to Docker). Make sure you reboot the instance after giving permission to the user.**
      - Pull the Docker image:
