### Hi, I hope you had a great day yesterday learning about the launch template and instances in EC2. Today, we are going to dive into one of the most important concepts in EC2: Load Balancing.

## What is Load Balancing?

Load balancing is the distribution of workloads across multiple servers to ensure consistent and optimal resource utilization. It is an essential aspect of any large-scale and scalable computing system, as it helps you to improve the reliability and performance of your applications.

## Elastic Load Balancing:

**Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. ELB provides three types of load balancers:

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** - _operates at layer 7 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require advanced routing and microservices._

- Read more from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html)

2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** - _operates at layer 4 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require high throughput and low latency._

- Read more from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html)

3. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** - _operates at layer 4 of the OSI model and is ideal for applications that require basic load balancing features._

## üéØ Today's Tasks:

### Task 1:

- launch 2 EC2 instances with an Ubuntu AMI and use User Data to install the Apache Web Server.
- Modify the index.html file to include your name so that when your Apache server is hosted, it will display your name also do it for 2nd instance which include " TrainWithShubham Community is Super Aweasome :) ".
- Copy the public IP address of your EC2 instances.
- Open a web browser and paste the public IP address into the address bar.
- You should see a webpage displaying information about your PHP installation.

### Task 2:

- Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in EC2 using the AWS Management Console.
- Add EC2 instances which you launch in task-1 to the ALB as target groups.
- Verify that the ALB is working properly by checking the health status of the target instances and testing the load balancing capabilities.
