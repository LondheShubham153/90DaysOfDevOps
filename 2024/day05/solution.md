
# Day 5 Answers: Advanced Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers with User Management

### Tasks

1. **Create Directories Using Shell Script:**
   - Write a bash script `createDirectories.sh` that, when executed with three arguments (directory name, start number of directories, and end number of directories), creates a specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.
   - Example 1: When executed as `./createDirectories.sh day 1 90`, it creates 90 directories as `day1 day2 day3 ... day90`.
   - Example 2: When executed as `./createDirectories.sh Movie 20 50`, it creates 31 directories as `Movie20 Movie21 Movie22 ... Movie50`.

2. **Create a Script to Backup All Your Work:**
   - Backups are an important part of a DevOps Engineer's day-to-day activities. The video in the references will help you understand how a DevOps Engineer takes backups (it can feel a bit difficult but keep trying, nothing is impossible).

3. **Read About Cron and Crontab to Automate the Backup Script:**
   - Cron is the system's main scheduler for running jobs or tasks unattended. A command called crontab allows the user to submit, edit, or delete entries to cron. A crontab file is a user file that holds the scheduling information.

4. **Read About User Management:**
   - A user is an entity in a Linux operating system that can manipulate files and perform several other operations. Each user is assigned an ID that is unique within the system. IDs 0 to 999 are assigned to system users, and local user IDs start from 1000 onwards.
   - Create 2 users and display their usernames.
