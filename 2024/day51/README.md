# Day 51: Your CI/CD pipeline on AWS - Part 2 üöÄ ‚òÅ

On your journey of making a CI/CD pipeline on AWS with these tools, you completed AWS CodeCommit.

Next few days you'll learn these tools/services:

- CodeBuild
- CodeDeploy
- CodePipeline
- S3

## What is CodeBuild ?

- AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers.

# Task-01 :

- Read about Buildspec file for Codebuild.
- create a simple index.html file in CodeCommit Repository
- you have to build the index.html using nginx server

# Task-02 :

- Add buildspec.yaml file to CodeCommit Repository and complete the build process.

Happy Learning :)
