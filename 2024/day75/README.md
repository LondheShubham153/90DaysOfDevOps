# Day 75 - Sending Docker Log to Grafana

We have monitored ,😉 that you guys are understanding and doing amazing with monitoring tool. 👌

Today, make it little bit more complex but interesting 😍 and let's add one more **Project** 🔥 to your resume.

## Task:

- Install _Docker_ and start docker service on a Linux EC2 through [USER DATA](../day39/README.md) .
- Create 2 Docker containers and run any basic application on those containers (A simple todo app will work).
- Now intregrate the docker containers and share the real time logs with Grafana (Your Instance should be connected to Grafana and Docker plugin should be enabled on grafana).
- Check the logs or docker container name on Grafana UI.
