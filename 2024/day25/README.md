# Day 25 Task: Complete Jenkins CI/CD Project - Continued with Documentation

You've been making amazing progress, so let's take a moment to catch up and refine our work. Today's focus is on completing the Jenkins CI/CD project from Day 24 and creating thorough documentation for it.

## Did you finish Day 24?

- Day 24 provided an end-to-end project experience, and adding this to your resume will be a significant achievement.

- Take your time to finish the project, create comprehensive documentation, and make sure to highlight it in your resume and share your experience.

## Task 1

- Document the entire process from cloning the repository to adding webhooks, deployment, and more. Create a detailed README file for your project. You can refer to [this example](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/fynd-my-movie/blob/master/README.md) for inspiration.

- A well-written README file will not only help others understand your project but also make it easier for you to revisit and use the project in the future.

## Task 2

- As it's a lighter day, set a small goal for yourself. Consider something you've been meaning to accomplish and use this time to focus on it.

- Share your goal and how you plan to achieve it using [this template](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shubhamlondhe1996_taking-resolutions-and-having-goals-for-an-activity-7023858409762373632-s2J8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

- Having small, achievable goals and strategies for reaching them is essential. Don't forget to reward yourself for your efforts!
