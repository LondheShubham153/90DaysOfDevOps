# Day 24 Task: Complete Jenkins CI/CD Project

Let's create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for your Node.js application! üòç

## Did you finish Day 23?

- Day 23 focused on Jenkins CI/CD, ensuring you understood the basics. Today, you'll take it a step further by completing a full project from start to finish, which you can proudly add to your resume. 
- As you've already worked with Docker and Docker Compose, you'll be integrating these tools into a live project.

## Task 1

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/node-todo-cicd.git).
2. Set up a connection between your Jenkins job and your GitHub repository through GitHub Integration.
3. Learn about [GitHub WebHooks](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-too-add-github-webhook-to-a-jenkins-pipeline-62b0be84e006) and ensure you have the CI/CD setup configured.
4. Refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/nplH3BzKHPk) for a step-by-step guide on the entire project.

## Task 2

1. In the "Execute Shell" section of your Jenkins job, run the application using Docker Compose.
2. Create a Docker Compose file for this project (a valuable open-source contribution).
3. Run the project and celebrate your accomplishment! üéâ
